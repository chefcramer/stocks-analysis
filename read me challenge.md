# VBA of Wallstreet

## Overview of Project

	This project is to analyze the overall performance of a data set of 12 different "Green" companies to determine which is the best investment opportunity. The Data was organized, analyzed and formatted using VBA (Visual Basic), a programming language that works in Microsoft Excel. This program streamlined the process by first asking the user what year that they would like to look at, and then examining all of the data and returning the total Daily volume traded and the total return percentage over that year. The process was further made more user friendly by the use of a button, and a message box asking for the year that is to be examined. The process is finished with a pop-up window stating how long it took the computer to run this code.

## Results
### Initial Coding to Begin the Analysis

	This screen shot shows the beginning work sheet for this analysis. The dialogue box asking which year you would like to analyze, the two buttons, the first to begin the analysis on all of the stocks and the second to clear all of the data and formatting. The coding for each individual item is as follows;
	- The dialogue box asking you which year you would like to examine, `yearValue = InputBox("What year would you like to run the analysis on?")`
	- this button is generated using this subroutine
	- and this button is generated using this subroutine
